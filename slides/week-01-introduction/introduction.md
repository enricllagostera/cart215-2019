# A vocabulary for game design

---

## What was changed in the game?

---

class: middle

## .hi[basic elements]: actions, goals, rules, objects, playspace, players

---

## Actions

- The activities players perform while playing. Some relate directly to a game’s goals, others don’t.
- Rules that **let players do something**.
- Actions allow players to communicate back to the game.
- Actions usually have **physical layers**.
- Actions **develop relationships** to other elements.
