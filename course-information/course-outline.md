## Description

This course is a general introduction to game design theory, analysis and practice. This course’s purpose is to foster an understanding of game design through the interplay of theory (lectures), analysis (game playing), design, and writing.

## Objectives

- Acquire critical and analytical concepts pertaining to games and their design.
- Understand game design as a means to shape player experience.
- Experience the complete process of game design, development, and refinement.
- Experiment with and navigate different approaches to game and play design.
- Learn to formulate and communicate game design ideas and projects.

## Key activities

### Lecture

Each class will include time spent with the instructor running through the week's topics, showing examples, and engaging in discussion over readings.

### Weekly exercises

Some weeks will include an evaluated exercise in which students will practice game design skills, engage with research, and/or reflect on their practice.

### Projects

There will be three graded projects during the course. Each will be used as an opportunity for students to practice and develop their game design skills in a variety of contexts and prompts, with room for their own creative ideas.

### Studio

All classes will include significant time for students to work on their projects and exercises with the instructor present to support both their technical and conceptual approach.

## Evaluation

Specific requirements and evaluation criteria for each component will be presented when assigned.

- 15% Physical Game Project (Group)
- 20% Card / Board Game Project (Group)
- 20% Digital Game Project (Individual)
- 20% Exam (Individual)
- 25% Participation / Exercises (Individual/Group)

## Policies

- According to departmental policy: 3 absences = failure.
- Late assignments will receive an automatic grade deduction of 10% per day, unless prior arrangements have been discussed.
- Unjustified absence on a required day for an assignment will result in a 10% deduction in its grade.

## Coursepack & Readings

This course requires that students acquire the course pack and read its content according to the calendar. The readings will be relevant to in-class discussions and necessary to the final exam. Most of the book chapters are also available on the library reserve.

## Academic Integrity

You must document in your assignments all ideas and media that have been incorporated into your projects, but have been borrowed from outside sources or from your colleagues. Failure to do so is considered as academic dishonesty and treated accordingly. For written assignments, all sources used in the development of your work must be cited as references. Where text is borrowed from another source, quotation marks must indicate the citation and the source must be acknowledged appropriately. A useful overview and relevant links are [available online via the Concordia Library site](http://library.concordia.ca/help/citing).
